// To get a individual element out of a tuple.
/*fn main() {
    let tup = (500, 6.4, 2);
    let (x, y, z) = tup; // take tup and binds it to three seperate variable also called
                         // desructuring, because it breaks the single tuple into three
    println!("The value of x is {x}, The value of y is {y}");
}*/





// Another way
/*fn main() {
    let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
    let five_hundered = x.0;
    let six_decimal_four = x.1;
    let one = x.2;

    println!("first {five_hundered}, second {six_decimal_four}, third {one}");
}*/
