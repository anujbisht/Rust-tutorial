// ------------------------ Functions ---------------------------
fn is used to create functions and rust use snake case in which all letters are lowercase and underscore seperate words

    Statements are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value.
    Expressions evaluate to a resultant value.
Functions can return values to the code that calls them. We donâ€™t name return values, but we must declare their type after an arrow (->)
