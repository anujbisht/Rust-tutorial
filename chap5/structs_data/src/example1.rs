//We create an instance by stating the name of the struct and then add curly brackets containing key: value pairs, where the keys are the names of the fields and the values are the data we want to store in those fields. We don’t have to specify the fields in the same order in which we declared them in the struct
/*struct User {
    active: bool,
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}*/
fn main() {
    let mut user1 = User {
        active: true,
        username: String::from("someusername123"),
        email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };
    user1.email = String::from("anotheremail@example.com"); // if the instance is mutable we can
                                                            // change the value 
}

// The entire instance must be mutable,Rust doesn’t allow us to mark only certain fields as mutable

/*fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
    User {
        active: true,
        username: username,
        email: email,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    }
}*/
// another way of doing it
fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
    User {
        active: true,
