Slices let you reference a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection rather than the whole collection. A slice is a kind of reference, so it does not have ownership.

iter is a method that returns each element in a collection and that enumerate wraps the result of iter and returns each element as part of a tuple instead

String Slices --> A string slice is a reference to part of a String
